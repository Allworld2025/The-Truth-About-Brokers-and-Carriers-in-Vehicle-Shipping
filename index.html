      <h2>Understanding the Key Players</h2>
      <p>When shipping a vehicle, you’ll encounter two main entities: <strong>brokers</strong> and <strong>carriers</strong>. Understanding their roles—and the myths surrounding them—is essential to making an informed decision. In this post, we’ll break down the truth about how each works, how they differ, and how <a href="https://www.amerifreight.net" target="_blank">AmeriFreight</a> simplifies the entire process.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight">
      <h2>Myth #1: Brokers Are Just Middlemen Who Increase the Cost</h2>
      <p>This is one of the biggest misconceptions. While brokers do act as intermediaries, they also provide immense value. A reputable broker like AmeriFreight helps you find the most reliable carrier at a competitive price, ensures paperwork is in order, and offers customer support throughout your shipment.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight alt">
      <h2>Myth #2: Going Direct with a Carrier Is Always Better</h2>
      <p>Working directly with a carrier can sometimes offer slightly lower rates, but it often comes with trade-offs: limited availability, less scheduling flexibility, and a lack of customer service. Plus, you're responsible for vetting the carrier yourself—something a broker already handles.</p>

      <h2>What Brokers and Carriers Actually Do</h2>

            <li>Ensure carriers are licensed and insured</li>
            <li>Manage scheduling and communication</li>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Carriers</h3>

            <li>Own and operate the transport trucks</li>
            <li>Physically move the vehicle</li>
            <li>Follow broker or customer instructions</li>
            <li>Manage pickups and deliveries</li>
